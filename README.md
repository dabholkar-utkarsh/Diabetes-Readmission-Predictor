# Diabetes Readmission Predictor: Revolutionizing Patient Care with Data Science


## Project Overview

This project focuses on leveraging advanced data science techniques to predict patient readmission rates among diabetic patients. Utilizing a dataset originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the model aims to identify key factors that contribute to the likelihood of readmission.

## Key Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict patient readmissions with an accuracy of 88%.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implements thorough data cleaning and preprocessing, reducing error rates by 50%.
- **Factor Analysis**: Identifies and analyzes key factors contributing to patient readmission.
